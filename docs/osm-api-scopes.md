## Scopes
Prefix each of the following scopes with 'section:' and add the suffix of ':read' or ':write' to determine if your application needs read access (:read) or read and write access (:write).

The 'administration' and 'finance' scopes have an additional suffix of ':admin' which is used for editing critical settings.
